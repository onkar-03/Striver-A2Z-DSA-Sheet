# C++ STL Overview

## C++ Language

- **High-Level Language**: C++ is one of the most popular high-level programming languages.
- **Extensively Used**: It has been used extensively by developers for a long time.
- **Popular Among Programmers**: Especially loved by competitive programmers due to its faster execution time.

## Standard Template Library (STL)

- **Unique Ability**: STL is one of the unique abilities of C++ that makes it stand out.
- **Definition**: STL stands for Standard Template Library.
- **Pre-Defined Templates**: Contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes.
- **Ease of Implementation**: Makes it easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures.
- **Space-Time Complexities**: Helps avoid the need to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.

## Templates in C++

- **Understanding Templates**: Diving deeper into STL requires understanding templates and how they work.
- **Powerful Tools**: Templates are one of the most powerful tools in C++ programming.

## Popular STL Containers and Algorithms

### Containers

1. **`unordered_set` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores unique elements in no particular order.

2. **`vector` in C++ STL**:

   - Dynamic array that can resize itself automatically.

3. **`set` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores unique elements in sorted order.

4. **`unordered_multiset` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores multiple occurrences of elements in no particular order.

5. **`multiset` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores multiple occurrences of elements in sorted order.

6. **`unordered_map` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores key-value pairs with unique keys in no particular order.

7. **`map` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores key-value pairs with unique keys in sorted order.

8. **`unordered_multimap` in C++ STL**:

   - Stores key-value pairs with multiple occurrences of keys in no particular order.

9. **`queue` in C++ STL**:

   - FIFO (First In First Out) data structure.

10. **`stack` in C++ STL**:

    - LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.

11. **`deque` in C++ STL**:

    - Double-ended queue allowing insertion and deletion at both ends.

12. **`priority_queue` in C++ STL**:

    - Stores elements in a priority order.

13. **`multimap` in C++ STL**:

    - Stores key-value pairs with multiple occurrences of keys in sorted order.

14. **`list` in C++ STL**:
    - Doubly linked list allowing insertion and deletion at both ends.

### Algorithms

1. **`next_permutation` in STL**:

   - Transforms the range into the next permutation.

2. **`__builtin_popcount()` in STL**:

   - Counts the number of set bits in an integer.

3. **`sort()` in C++ STL**:

   - Sorts the elements in the range in ascending order.

4. **`min_element()` in C++ STL**:

   - Finds the smallest element in the range.

5. **`max_element()` in C++ STL**:
   - Finds the largest element in the range.
